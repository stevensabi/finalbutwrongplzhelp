From the teachers point of view
This is a desktop application 
so it should pull up the advices with a dropdown and then you can click on them to bring up a blank form which contains the students info an the option to add a course or remove a course 
it should have 10 fake students 
having registration in progress as a sign is out of scope as well as viewing estimate their courses that they need 
any prerequisites or out of sorts to 
there is a database behind it which is permanent, and it should be able to read the master schedule which is the current schedule that you will have after each addition to it
It should show the students first name, last name, email, ID number, GPA ,credits zero to 120 ,hometown, state ,major ,optional minor ,an if they are a resident or commuter  
 it should be a course like by Thomas it should start with the number 6 and there should be 5 digits there should be the course name course number the CRN which is the 5 digits that I mentioned before there is the section date and time if it's online or offline the start time and time professor the number and the Max number 
better martyrs changed how many students are signed up for a certain course is out of scope WhatsApp
this should be the students ID 2 course ID with two columns 
there's no formal registrar 
There should be some kind of login it should meet ferpa regulations it should be able to connect within a few seconds and needs to be able to restrict access and have low permission logins there should also be a made up username and password for the teacher login ;
a login box should pop up just make up a random username and password for it then hash the password and store it in a text file 
there should be a random salt so the password plus salt and then the hash and that should be in the tax file 
is for the inscription stuff copy connection string height 
computer literate 
the dimensions should be 1280 by 800 
so my specific thing is adding fake picture for the students and they should be 200 by 200
